2.  Custom Hook for API Fetching

        •	Modification: Instead of fetching from an API, simulate data fetching with a setTimeout inside the custom hook to return hardcoded data.
        •	Reasoning: Demonstrates understanding of hooks without requiring a live API.
        •	Example Output: [{ id: 1, name: "John" }, { id: 2, name: "Jane" }]

    Objective
    To create a reusable custom React hook (useFetch) that simulates fetching data asynchronously. This hook will handle:

1.  Managing loading and error states.
1.  Returning the fetched data after a delay using setTimeout.
    This challenge emphasizes understanding custom hooks, state management, and asynchronous logic in React, without relying on external APIs.
