Dynamic Search with Debounce

            •	Modification: Replace the mock API with a hardcoded array of strings (e.g., a list of usernames or products). Filter the list based on user input and debounce the filtering logic.
            •	Reasoning: This focuses on state management and debounce logic rather than API calls.
            •	Example Input: [`John`, `Jane`, `Jack``, `Jill``, `James`]

            Objective
            To build a dynamic search component that:

            - Filters a hardcoded list of items (e.g., usernames, products) as the user types.
            - Implements debouncing to improve performance by reducing unnecessary computations while the user is still typing.
            This challenge emphasizes state management, efficient filtering, and debouncing logic without relying on external APIs.
