4.  Real-Time Location Tracker

        •	Modification: Replace live geolocation with a hardcoded set of coordinates. Use the coordinates to center the map.
        •	Reasoning: Focus on integration with react-native-maps rather than geolocation.
        •	Example Coordinates: { latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -tel:122.4194 }

    To create a React Native app that:

1.  Integrates with react-native-maps to display a map centered on a hardcoded set of coordinates.
1.  Emphasizes map rendering and React Native's map integration rather than fetching live geolocation data.
